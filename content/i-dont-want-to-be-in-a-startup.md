Being in a _startup_ means going to _startup_ events to meet other _startups_ and talk about _startups_. You may think of a "startup" as two guys working feverishly in a garage and suddenly dropping the bomb of a revolutionary new product onto the unsuspecting world. But what I saw is best summarized by a friend's comment: "_have you actually seen them ship anything?_"

Business is about earning money, and you do that by delivering something of value to a customer. A "_customer_" is, by definition of a befriended accountant, "_someone who __paid___." Startups, in order to be legitimate businesses, also need someone to pay and they indeed find such people. They're called venture capitalists.

Now, before you start sending me examples of startups actually delivering something and getting paid for it, I assure you I've seen them. I just wouldn't call them startups. You won't meet their founders on most startup events. You _can_ meet them__ at work__, when they're not __meeting their customers__, or spend quality time with their cherished families. They're just plain, old _businesses_.
