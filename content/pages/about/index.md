I'm what you would call a "full stack developer" these days, based in Warsaw, Poland. I deliver software, from the front-end all the way to the depths of the back-end. Occasionally I manage infrastructure too.

This blog is an __outlet for my thinking about the business of software__---both the technology and the people building it. I write mostly for selfish reasons. One, I simply like writing. Two, it's an excellent way to test my thinking, by exposing holes that become evident only when a loose network of thoughts must be organized into an orderly, linear piece of text. Three, publishing stuff for anyone to see sets a certain standard and takes away any excuses I may have for sloppy writing. It's good practice too.

Away from computers, I'm an [__active cyclist__](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17745574). I used to be a triathlete, competing on distances ranging from Sprint to IronMan 70.3---that's the _half_ IronMan, hence the 70.3 suffix, being the total distance _in miles_. Sadly, my legs didn't enjoy running much (and I didn't enjoy swimming that much), so I fell back to cycling.
