I'm what you would call a "full stack developer" these days, based in Warsaw, Poland. I deliver software, from the front-end all the way to the depths of the back-end.

This blog is an __outlet for my thinking about the business of software__---both the technology and the people building it. I write mostly for selfish reasons. One, I simply like writing. Two, it's an excellent way to test my thinking, by exposing holes that become evident only when a loose network of thoughts must be organized into an orderly, linear piece of text. Three, publishing stuff for anyone to see sets a certain standard and takes away any excuses I may have for sloppy writing. It's good practice too.

If you're finding any of the content published here useful, do let me know.

Away from computers, I'm an [__active triathlete__](https://triathlon.paluchowski.com), competing on distances ranging from Sprint to IronMan 70.3---that's the _half_ IronMan, hence the 70.3 suffix, being the total distance _in miles_. Triathlon is excellent because it's a real-life game of strategy. It takes discipline and grit to build endurance and fitness required by races, but it also takes a lot of thought to prepare all the equipment, pace yourself correctly and apply all the other strategies needed to get ahead. I learn a lot from triathlons that applies to software development.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mpaluchowski), and now and then I share bits of code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpaluchowski).
