We all communicate. If you're reading this, then I am communicating a message to you and if I don't structure, construct and present it well, you'll stop reading after the next sentence. Or worse, you'll read to the end and forget all about it minutes afterwards. That would mean we both wasted time - me writing, you reading.

There's no excuse for inefficient communication.

Have you joined your local [Toastmasters](http://www.toastmasters.org/ "Toastmasters International website") chapter already? I know, I know, you don't _do_Â public speaking. It's not _your thing_. Don't worry, it's just a form they use. What you will learn goes far beyond presenting and will forever change your life.
