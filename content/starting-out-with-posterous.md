Ten or so may be the number of times I landed on the Posterous home page and "almost" clicked the "register" button. I have a blog already, I have a Twitter account. Why have another? Now I gave in, I'm here.

Posterous is a quick place to express a thought before it vanishes. It's perfect for a moment of enlightenment, when time's too scarce to produce anything more than a crude summary. There's more space, however, than the 140 characters Twitter offers and thus I can hopefully express myself better.

Happy reading!
