It's not unusual for conferences to cost _an arm and a leg_. At €1,000 or more for just the entry, on top of which come travel and accommodation, and I often attend two or three events a year. That's a _pile_ of money in need of justification spending, and I can only do so if I bring back lots of valuable information. Here's what I do nowadays---the tools and tricks I worked out for surviving and thriving as a conference attendee.

## Preparation

During a conference I want to focus strictly on acquiring information and connecting with other attendees, so to free up time I prepare a lot upfront.

__Session selection__ comes first. Conference schedules usually appear piece by piece, so a week or two before the event I go through all sessions and plan my agenda. The last thing I want is to make haphazard, effectively random decisions at the venue.

* If I'm attending with any colleagues, we sit down together to split up the sessions and cover more ground.
* If there's more than one interesting session in a given time slot, I write down all of them and prioritize. This way I have more options when my first choice turns out to be a flop or suddenly gets canceled.

I __add selected sessions into Google Calendar__, synchronized across all of my devices. Some conferences have dedicated apps to store one's schedule, but these [may or may not work to my liking][mp-trusting-software] or could have issues on shaky Wi-Fi. Plus I quickly would've acquired a pile of useless apps and accounts.

I'm really big on notes. Before the conference I __setup a fresh Google Doc__, since I'll be [taking notes on a tablet][mp-paper-big-future], with pre-entered:

* sections for each chosen session, ordered chronologically,
* names and
* Twitter handles of speakers.

Using Google Docs has a number of advantages:

* I can __share the document__ with colleagues, both at the venue or back at the office, where they can follow me in real-time,
* Google Docs' context-aware spellchecker is pretty decent, which helps a lot when (mis)typing on a tablet,
* the chronological order lets me get ready quickly by opening the document and scrolling down to the next empty section,
* speakers' Twitter handles make __live tweeting__ easier.

I'll often write the Twitter handles with the conference hashtags, ie.:

```
 @mpaluchowski #craftconf
```

Note the leading space. This snippet I can easily copy and paste after every quote I tweet during a session.

## D-Day(s)

The conference days are always intense, both physically as well as mentally, so my focus here is to stay light and fit.

I __carry my own shoulder bag__, currently the excellent Camel Active Dakar, which contains my tablet, wallet, business cards and a pen or two.

{{< figure src="/michals-conference-war-chest/camel-active-dakar-bag.jpg" alt="Camel Active Dakar shoulder bag" >}}

Conferences usually hand out their own bags, but most of these aren't convenient to carry around for a full day. I carefully selected a good bag, that:

* keeps my __hands free__ all day---especially beneficial at standing lunches,
* doesn't bite into my shoulder(s),
* doesn't bump around my hip thanks to its vertical orientation,
* easily __fits into my lap__ during a session, when space is tight,
* carries everything I need---the Camel one can easily carry a 12" laptop or A4-sized documents.

My __device for note taking is currently the [iPad Air 2][apple-ipad-air2]__. A laptop wouldn't do because the vast majority won't last a full day on batteries and I sure as hell don't want to waste time on recharging.

Typing on a tablet is pretty cumbersome, but gets better with practice, plus Google Docs' spellchecker helps a lot, and anyway I won't be publishing raw notes anywhere without post-processing. A colleague is happy doing notes on an [iPad Mini][apple-ipad-mini] so the smaller form factor could work as well.

__iOS 9's Peek function__ was a real blessing, since [I tweet a lot][twitter-mpaluchowski] during sessions, on top of taking notes. Earlier I had to keep switching between the Google Docs and Twitter apps, whereas now I can just slide in Twitter on the side for a quick tweet and return to notes. Thanks, Apple!

A conference day is __really hard for the body__ since I spend a lot of time sitting still in sessions, while my brain keeps working in high gear, burning lots of fuel and not getting nearly enough oxygen to [clean up the trash from metabolism][brain-rules-move]. This means unless I [pay attention to my body][mp-living-up], by the end of day I'll likely develop a headache and won't see much from the conference party. So I:

* __drink a _lot_ of water__, either carry my own bottle and keep sipping during sessions, or drink a glass at each break. The side effect is having to visit the bathroom often, but there's a trick to that too.
* __move a lot in between sessions__---no sitting, lots of walking, gesticulation, even leaving the venue when possible.
* __eat light__, opting for complex fuel sources, like protein or complex carbohydrates. No pastry or sweets of any kind---these would burn up quickly leaving me hungry and distracted.

Finally, I try to sit near convenient exit rows, so that I can easily leave the session if I don't like it, or reach the toilet before the crowd does. Trust me, this _is_ a real problem during male-dominated software events.

## Post-processing

There's little value in all the information I acquire at a conference if it stays inside my head. Sharing it with others and turning it into action is where the payoff starts.

Conferences are often followed by a weekend, which is super convenient since I can focus on something completely different and then go back to my notes with a __fresh look on Monday morning__.

It takes me a day or so to process notes, where I rearrange them to:

* group into __common themes__, ie. microservices, DDD, [Agile][mp-agile] etc.,
* reorder into something that makes sense in the context, rather than whatever the speaker(s) thought would,
* list out __tools, books, blog posts and other resources__ I saw mentioned,
* later add links to talk recordings, once they were posted.

Finally, I produce a __brief summary__ from the pile of information, adding my own judgment of where I see the industry right now, or how it changed compared with previous conferences. This usually turns into a [blog][mp-craftconf] [post][mp-socrates], richly decorated with photos and tweets from the event.

We take a look at all materials with my colleagues to decide [what is most relevant to us and what we'd like to try out][mp-architects] now or later. These go into our regular planning and I get back to everyday work, counting down to the next great conference.
