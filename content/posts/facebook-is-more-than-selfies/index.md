Should we all just [#DeleteFacebook](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeleteFacebook)? I mean, [throughout 2018 they demonstrated](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/literally-just-a-big-list-of-facebooks-2018-scandals) just how dirty a business they're inside. And honestly, when was the last time you *enjoyed* your timeline? It's going to be hard, though, to replace this massive communication platform for their [2B+ users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/).

Basecamp has a brand, and for their, mostly technically sophisticated, users, it's alright to skip Facebook as a communication medium. How about the rest of the world, though?

 - cafes with patrons
 - road construction
 - cycling path investments
 - events (Gran Fondo Gdynia, IronMan Gdynia)
 - traffic disruptions
- Messenger IM, that doesn't need a phone number or email address, just a name
- can't just ["build personal websites"](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites)
- cut out most of personal information, ie. work history, old photos
