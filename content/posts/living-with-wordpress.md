[Posterous][posterous] is likely gone by the time you're reading this. [Acquired by Twitter in 2012][tcposteroustwitter], [closed down in the end of April 2013][tcposterousshutdown]. I checked my options and considering:

<!--more-->

* existing URLs need to work for SEO reasons,
* I'm not willing to pay much for hosting this blog, writing being a minor side activity that I do,
* I want to avoid moving this elsewhere again in a few months if another Posterous-like service goes down.

In the end I went for a self-hosted WordPress instance. It's just the easiest way to go - actively maintained platform, huge community, really easy to set-up and I could both configure URLs as well as redirections where needed. My bottom line is: I just need a place to write and publish.

If you find anything broken, please be so kind and [let me know][twittermpaluchowski]. I might have missed it.

Later I will likely take some time to design my own theme - simple, minimalist, content first. For the moment enjoy the visually excellent design byÂ [SiteOrigin][siteorigin].
