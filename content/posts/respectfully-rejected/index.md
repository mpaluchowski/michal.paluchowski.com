"I'm sure _somebody_ will get in touch with you", sneered the Google developer, closing a phone interview I went through years ago. By then I knew I wouldn't get the job, but these words and their tone convinced me that I shouldn't try again for years to come. The way in which a company rejects job candidates speaks tomes about its culture.

Google was merely one of many similar experiences. I once called up a company to ask for my interview's results, having received no answer. The lady I connected with looked up my application and replied, "oh, says here you know too little about the software development process". Thanks for telling me.

[Rejection happens to the best of us][mphowhardhit]. History knows countless cases where individuals were sent away as unfit for a job, then built exceptional success elsewhere. Without much digging:

- Chris Wanstrath was [rejected for job at Yahoo][defunktrejected] and went on to found GitHub.
- Larry Page and Sergey Brin [couldn't sell Google for a measly $1M to Yahoo, Excite and Infoseek][pagebrinhistory], later rejected Yahoo's $3B buyout offer.
- J.K. Rowling's [Harry Potter was rejected by several publishers][jkrowlingrejected], one accepted and she became one of the richest women in the world.

It's tempting to think of a candidate who didn't pass the interview as just not smart or talented enough. That's __almost always bollocks__. It's much more likely that the person you just met either

1. __didn't work long enough__ with the domain you interviewed for; or
2. __doesn't have the right profile__ - character or set of talents.

That means the same person might become a __very good match later on__, when he or she [gains more experience][mptalkabout] (1), or a different position opens up, calling for their unique skills (2). Besides, in the rapidly shifting world of business, one day _you_ could again be meeting that same person, and this time you'll be the one answering questions.

Leaving candidates with a bad memory of the recruitment process is therefore ludicrous, and [great companies][mpgeekheaven], like [Fog Creek Software][fogcreek], know it:

> Recruiting is a series of delicate communications. It's about managing a candidate's experience and expectations throughout the interview process. It's marketing and PR: everyone you talk to leaves with an impression of the company. A recruiter creates the company's brand, and, if done right, __leaves a candidate still wanting to work for you even after they've been rejected__. [emphasis mine]
>

It's really very simple, though admittedly not _easy_. Every candidate should receive

- __honesty__ - a [full evaluation][mpfeeditback] of their interview, time permitting;
- __constructiveness__ - advice on how they may improve to become ready for the position they applied for; and
- __positivity__ - all of the above in a friendly, respective manner.

Such experiences provide answers to the often unsaid questions every promising candidate will have: Will I be given freedom to fail and the support to learn from it? How will I be told when I err and how I can correct my ways? Is this a place where I can grow?

Yours may a company that does all that for employees, but you have to make sure it __shows just as vividly in your interviews__, especially those where someone gets rejected.

People remember. Negative experiences remain in memory much sharper than positive ones, and every rejection _by nature_ is negative already. Don't make it worse. You want people to see your company as a great place that just may not have been fitting at the time:
