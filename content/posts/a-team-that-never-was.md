You cannot build a team merely by replacing "_me_" for "_we_" in communication. You won't get there either by placing people in one room and giving them a common name. A __team__ is much more than a group of individuals sharing the same space and some characteristics. What binds a team is __spirit__, not labels.

<!--more-->

A team:

- __shares a common goal__, which must not be a vague statement like "customer satisfaction" or "top quality". Instead, it has to be a plain, concrete, down-to-earth target like "_delivering version 10.1 with killer feature Banana Split by the next holiday season_." To get there team members have to:
- __share work__, not receive their own tasks, and submerge in them for 3 months without anyone else around knowing. Members must operate together, like a Navy Seals expedition - switch posts, cover each others' backs, communicate regularly to keep everyone informed of the common progress towards the established goal, as well as encountered risks and problems.

A __leader's__ role in team building is defining and distributing work in such a way, that naturally requires team cooperation to achieve goals. Ideally, failure to cooperate should result in failure of the whole team. Remember the movie "[300](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/ "300 on Internet Movie Database")"? Leonidas explains to the deformed Ephialtes how Spartans fight: as a __single, impenetrable unit__. Arm to arm, fighting the same enemy, protecting each other. That is team spirit.
