Who _are_ you? How do you expect me to _trust_ you? I know you do, because you're trying to sell me something. You're a startup; you put together a cool tool, working with your friends in a garage. You're ready to hit the market. No-one knows you.

When you don't have past achievements to speak for you, then all you have is __transparency__. Blog, tweet, _share_. Write about your ups and downs, explain your philosophy, speak of what you learn while working. It's not likely to get you a seven-figure order, but it will build trust among your prospective customers and at some point some exec with a budget surplus will say "o hell, let's check these guys out."
