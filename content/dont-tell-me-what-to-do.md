"_Eat your broccoli!_", "_Clean your room!_", "_Brush your teeth!_" Sounds familiar? It's the tune of the past, when your parents controlled each and every aspect of your life. With the exception of toilet use, perhaps. For many people however, the past lives on. Parents turned into line managers, while kids remained kids, but with fancy titles: Senior Software Engineer, Enterprise Architect, etc. "_Send that e-mail_", "_call that guy_", "_re-estimate that plan_." _Smart_ managers turn orders into questions: "_can you send that e-mail, please?_" Sure, boss.

Parents order their offspring around assuming that children don't have the required knowledge and experience to decide what to do, when and how. Many managers think along the same lines: if I don't tell them what to do they'll surely do it wrong. Great intentions with lousy results:

- __makes the employees unhappy__ - after all they went through a whole recruitment process, assessment centers and whatnot, emerged victoriously from among a dozen brilliant candidates, just to be treated like 3-year-olds.
- __makes for ineffective work__ - even if employees really do make mistakes, they can learn better only by seeing them for themselves. Any direct micromanagement will sabotage the learning process, causing the same situations to repeat over and over again.

A manager is not super-human. He makes mistakes just like any other bloke and there's absolutely __no guarantee__ that his procedures and decisions are in any way more effective than anyone else's. Managers are there to set goals and provide their subordinates with resources to move forward as they see fit. Any other form of management is just a waste of brainpower.
